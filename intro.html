    <h2>All about me</h2>
    <p>
        I've been in I.T. for 35 years, starting off in 1989 at IBM. Before then however I was already playing with
        computers. The good old BBC Micro at school and BBC Basic being my first programming experience. I started out
        as a trainee network engineer, learning to code at college and dabbling some at work. Then after having initial
        success as a network engineer in a couple of organisations, there was that one fateful day where one of the lead
        developers asked me "can you code?" to which of course I said yes, well a little that is. He sat me down at the
        PC (i386 Windows 98) and Visual Studio 4-ish. After four weeks I had debugged and released the latest update.
        The next 25 years I went from basic junior developer to lead developer. In between still having to maintain the
        network as of course they did not employ anyone else to do that! I then moved into low level management, still
        coding to a point. Initially heading up the support team as well as a team of developers. From
        support/development manager that morphed into a full engineering manager for a number of years. Eventually ended
        my glorious full time career as the Head of Engineering.

        So what now, well at the time of writing this I'm sort of retired. I'm refreshing my coding skills by completing
        an online Full stack developer course, Javascript, HTML/CSS, REACT, C#, SQL and a few other things. It's more
        something to do to keep the mind active at this point.

        In between this I'm getting a lot of golf in and learning piano. However, my golf has not
        improved.

        Here I will be posting an article or two which I'm going to write based on my experience in I.T. and Business. I
        really hope that someone reads this and gets at least some insight out of it. I will also be updating the look
        and feel of this site as I go along. I'm doing this without the aid of AI for the moment, just so I get a sense
        of achievement.
